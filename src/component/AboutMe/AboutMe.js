        Well hello there! I'm Tenzin Thinley, just a self-taught developer who
        happens to have a masters in physics.
        <br />
        I'm passionate about building beautiful and user-friendly web apps that
        are out of this world! My expertise lies in ReactJS, JavaScript, HTML,
        CSS, SCSS, Django, and SQL, but I'm always eager to learn new things and
        expand my skillset. <br /> I take pride in my professional attitude and
        strong work ethic, and I'm constantly striving to utilize all of the
        academic and non-academic experiences I've gained along the way. <br />I
        believe that being an asset to a company means more than just having
        technical skills, it means being a team player, a problem solver, and
        someone who's always looking for ways to improve. So if you're looking
        for a frontend developer who's both quirky and competent, look no
        further!
